**Zoom Web SDK Notice from Zoom Itself**

The Web SDK enables the development of video applications powered by Zoom’s core framework inside an HTML5 web client through a highly optimized WebAssembly module.

As an extension of the Zoom browser client, this SDK is intended for implementations where the end user has a low-bandwidth environment, is behind a network firewall, or has restrictions on their machine which would prevent them from installing the Zoom Desktop or Mobile Clients.

**SHORTCODE:**

**You can get your shorcodes from individual meetings after creating certain meeting. (From version 3.1.8+)**

* [zoom_api_link meeting_id="123456789" link_only="no"] - Just enter your meeting ID and you are good to show your meeting in any page. Adding link_only="yes" would show join link only. See [Usage Documentation](https://techies23.github.io/video-conference-zoom/ "Usage Documentation") for more detail on usage.

* [zoom_api_webinar webinar_id="YOUR_WEBINAR_ID" link_only="no"] - Show webinar details based on webinar ID.

* [zoom_list_meetings per_page="5" category="test,test2,test3" order="DESC" filter="no"] - Show list of meetings in frontend via category, Edit shortcode template for table view.

* [zoom_list_webinars per_page="5" category="test,test2,test3" order="DESC" filter="no"] - Show list of webinars in frontend via category, Edit shortcode template for table view.

* [zoom_list_host_meetings host="your_host_id"] - Show list of meetings in frontend for specific HOST ID.

* [zoom_recordings host_id="YOUR_HOST_ID" downloadable="yes"] - Show list of recordings based on HOST ID. By default downloadable is set to false.

* [zoom_recordings_by_meeting meeting_id="MEETING_ID" downloadable="yes"] - which shows recordings based on meeting ID.

**QUICK DEMO:**

== Installation ==
Search for the plugin -> add new dialog and click install, or download and extract the plugin, and copy the the Zoom plugin folder into your wp-content/plugins directory and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Add users not working for me =

The plugin settings allow you to add and manage users. But, you should remember that you can add users in accordance with the Zoom Plans, so they will be active for the chosen plan. More information about Zoom pricing plans you can find here: https://zoom.us/pricing

= Join via Browser not working, Camera and Audio not detected =

This issue is because of HTTPS protocol. You need to use HTTPS to be able to allow browser to send audio and video.

= Blank page for Single Meetings page =

If you face blank page in this situation you should refer to [Template Overriding](https://zoom.codemanas.com/template_override/#content-not-showing "Template Overriding") and see Template override section.

This happens because of the single meeting page template from the plugin not being supported by your theme and i cannot make my plugin support for every theme page template because of which you'll need to override the plugin template from my plugin to your theme's standard. ( Basically, like how WooCommerce does!! )

= Countdown not showing/ guess is undefined error in my console log =

If countdown is not working for you then the first thing you'll nweed to verify is whether your meeting got created successfully or not. You can do so by going to wp-admin > Zoom Meetings > Select your created meeting and on top right check if there are "Start Meeting", "join Meeting links". If there are those links then, you are good on meeting.

However, even though meeting is created and you are not seeing countdown timer then, you might want to check your browser console and see if there is any "guess is undefined" error. If so, there might be a plugin conflict using the same moment.js library. **Report to me in this case**

= Forminator plugin conflict fix =

Please check this thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-forminator-2/

= How to show Zoom Meetings on Front =

* By using shortcode like [zoom_api_link meeting_id="123456789"] you can show the link of your meeting in front.

= How to override plugin template to your theme =

1. Goto **wp-content/plugins/video-conferencing-with-zoom-api/templates**
2. Goto your active theme folder to create new folder. Create a folder such as **yourtheme/video-conferencing-zoom/{template-file.php}**
3. Replace **template-file.php** with the file you need to override.
4. Overriding shortcode template is also the same process inside folder **templates/shortcode**

= Do i need a Zoom Account ? =

Yes, you should be registered in Zoom. Also, on the plan you are using there depends the number of hosts and users you can add.
