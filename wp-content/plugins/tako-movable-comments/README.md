This plugin allows you to move comments from one post or page to another. You can also move comments across post types and custom post types. Just click on edit comments and move your comments through the 'Move Comments with Tako' metabox.

## Description

By using this plugin, admins no longer need to manually insert the post ID number. Instead, admins can choose the post title through a drop down list. This allows admins to choose the post title that they want to move the comments to easily. This plugin also allows admin to move comments in bulk. 

As of now, there are similar plugins that exist. However, these plugins require the admin to manually insert the post's ID number and they do not automatically move nested comments. Tako Movable Comments aims to enhance this feature and allow admins to move comments easily.
