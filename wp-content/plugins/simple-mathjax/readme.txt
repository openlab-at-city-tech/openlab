Yet another plugin to add MathJax support to your wordpress blog.
Just wrap your equations inside $ signs and MathJax will render them visually.

== Description ==

This wordpress plugin is yet another simple plugin to load the [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) scripts at the bottom of all of your pages. It uses a very all-inclusive mathjax configuration by default, with $'s and $$'s the default delimeters for in-line and displayed equations.

A preference pane is added to the "Settings" group where you can choose whether to use MathJax version 2 or 3, change the MathJax server location (CDN) and the MathJax configuration settings. (See [this page](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#using-in-line-configuration-options) for details on the options available.) 
You can also specify a LaTeX "preamble" of newcommands which will be loaded in a hidden element near the top of each page.

Fork this plugin on [GitHub](https://github.com/boolesrings/Simple-Mathjax-wordpress-plugin).
