Light weight fully customizable reading progress bar. Sticks to top, bottom or sticky menu, with fallback for small screens

== Description ==
The reading progress bar is a great user experience on longreads. Especially if it accurately depicts the reading progress in the article text, and nothing else. This is standard on single blog posts and enabled by default.

Customization:

- Location top of screen, bottom of screen or below a sticky menu.

- Choose color of the reading progress bar.

- Have the bar start at 0% even when part of the article is visible.

- Select post types you wish the bar to appear, or individual posts.

Behaviour:

- The reading progress bar has smooth initializing since part of the text may already be visible, after that a lightweight update-function ensures quick response while scrolling.

- The bar can attach itself to any (sticky) element that you define as an admin, when there are multiple, the first visible element will be used.

- When there is no (longer a) visible element to attach to, the bar displays at the top.

- If there is no single article identified (by class names or id) it uses the whole page to calculate progress.

This is my 6th WordPress plugin but my first one freely available to everybody. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoy building it!

Regards,
Joeri

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin by clicking ‘Install now’ below, or the ‘Download’ button, and put the WP-reading-progress folder in your plugins folder

2. By default, it only works on single blog posts and uses an orange colour

3. Go to settings->WP Reading Progress to customize it

Upon uninstall WP Reading Progress removes its own options and `post_meta` data (if any) leaving no traces.

== Screenshots ==
1. Example of the reading progress bar on my photography blog
2. WP Reading Progress settings page
3. Activate the bar for an individual post (if that post type is not enabled)

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.5.1 =

For speed the plugin looks for elements to stick to only once per request, this should work. If not, please let me know and downgrade to 1.5.0 in the meantime.

= 1.4.0 =

The bar will select between multiple elements when available and pick the first one in the viewport. If you use it with a sticky element please check whether it still behaves as you expect, or stick it to a better element from now on.

If you upgrade from a version before 1.3.0, you have to check the `post` post type in the WP Reading Bar settings manually to keep the same behaviour.
