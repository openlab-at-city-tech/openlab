The Simple Pull Quote WordPress Plugin provides an easy way for you to insert pull quotes into your posts and pages.  

== Description ==

Simple Pull Quote Wordpress Plugin provides an easy way for you to insert pull quotes into your posts and pages.  It adds an easy-to-use "Pullquote" button to both the HTML and TinyMCE editors. 



== Installation ==

1. Either use the built-in Wordpress plugin installer to grab the plugin from the Wordpress plugin repository, or upload the entire contents of the `simple-pull-quote.zip` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: How do I make the quote appear on the left side?  
A: After you create your pull quote, add “class=“left” to it like this: [pullquote class="left”]TEXT HERE[/pullquote]

Q: What if I am using a visual editor besides TinyMCE?
A: You will need to manually add the shortcode [pullquote]YOUR TEXT HERE[/pullquote]

Q: Is there a maximum number of pull quotes I can have on a single blog post or page?
A: No.  You can have as many pull quotes as you would like.

Q: How do I change the colors and background image on the pullquotes?
A: Override the default "simplePullQuote" class in your theme's CSS file.  Here is a “How To” video about this: http://youtu.be/qvg2BFnN0pQ
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvg2BFnN0pQ]

Q: Where is the "Pullquote" button in the HTML editor?
A: I don't know.  It disappeared with the most recent version of WordPress, and I am working on fixing it.

= How do I update the look of the pull quotes? =

To change the look of your pull quotes, open your theme's "style.css" file and create a CSS class called "simplePullQuotes".  Edit this class according to your tastes.  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure your theme's "wp_head()" function comes before your theme's stylesheet or else this won't work.

= How do I use more than one pull quote in a single post or page? =

Simply select the text that you want to use as a pull quote and click the "Pullquote" button in either the visual or html editor.
