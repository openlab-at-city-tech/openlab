== Description ==

[PRO](http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/ "Go Pro") | [DEMO](https://demo.pimteam.net/wp/?p=12)

**This plugin is constantly maintained and developed since 10 years!**

Create exams, surveys, and quizzes and display the result immediately after the user completes the questionnaire. You can assign grades and point levels for every grade in the exam / quiz. Then assign points to every answer to a question and Watu Quiz will figure out the grade based on the total number of points collected.

Watu Quiz is a light version of <a href="http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/" target="_blank">Watu PRO</a>. Check it if you want to run fully featured exams with data exports, student logins, elaborate grading system, categories, reports, data analysis, etc.

### Attention  WordPress Network (Multi Site) Users ###

When activating the plugin do it as blog admin and not as network admin.

### Online Demo ###

Feel free to check the [live demo here](https://demo.pimteam.net/wp/?p=12 "Live demo"). It should answer most "pre-download" questions.
If you have more doubts just download the plugin and check out if it works for you. It's free and takes a few seconds to install and activate.

### Troubleshooting ###

**When opening a support thread please provide URL (link) where we can see your problem.**

A very common problem is not being able to submit the quiz, or the quiz does not displays at all. This is usually a fatal JavaScript error caused by other plugins or your them. If you are technical you can easily find the error yourself by checking the JavaScript error console in Chrome or Firefox. Disable the offending plugin and everything will start working normally.

### Developers API ###

In order to allow other plugins to integrate better to Watu we have started working on developers API.
The following action calls are currently available:

= do_action('watu_exam_submitted', $taking_id)  
Called when exam is submitted, passes the attempt ID

= do_action('watu_exam_submitted_detailed', $taking_id, $exam, $user_ID, $achieved, $g_id)  
Same as above but passes also the full exam object, the user ID, points and grade ID

= do_action('watu_exam_saved', $exam_id)
Called when you add or edit exam (after submitting the changes). Passes the changed exam ID.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the entire folder `watu` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to "Watu Settings" to change the default settings (optional)
1. Go to "Watu Quizzes" under "Tools" menu to create your exams, add questions, answers and grades. On the "manage questions" page of the created exam page, above the questions table you will see a green text. It shows you the code you need to enter in a post content where you want the exam to appear.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are grades calculated? =

Watu computes the number of points in total collected by the answers given by the visitor. Then it finds the grade. For example: If you have 2 questions and the correct answers in them give 5 points each, the visitor will collect either 0, or 5 or 10 points at the end. You may decide to define grades "Failed" for 0 to 4 points and "Passed" for those who collected more than 4 points. In reality you are going to have more questions and answers and some answers may be partly correct which gives you full flexibility in assigning points and managing the grades.

= Can I assign negative points? =

Yes. It's even highly recommended for answers to questions that allow multuple answers. If you just assign 0 points to the wrong answers in such question the visitor could check all the checkboxes and collect all the points to that question.

= How do I show the quiz to the visitors of my blog? =

You need to create a post and embed the exam code. The exam code is shown in the green text above the questions table in "Manage questions" page for that exam.

**Please do not place more than one code in one post or page. Only one exam will be shown at a time. If you wish more tests to be displayed, please give links to them!**

= How does it handle user accounts? =

Watu Quiz uses the WordPress user registration / login system. So if you want to allow users to register for quizzes simply select "Require user login" in the Edit Quiz page and make sure "Anyone can register" is selected in your WordPress Settings page.

= How to embed videos in questions? =

To embed a video from Youtube or a similar remotely hosted video, use the embed shortcode like this: [embed width="680" height="420"]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ[/embed].

To embed locally hosted video you can use the "Add media" button in the rich text editor and insert your video. Sometimes this doesn't work even in posts so you may want to install some of the many available video player plugins.

= Is it compatible with BuddyPress or membership plugins? =

Since it uses the standard WordPress user login system, it is compatible with BuddyPress and all membership plugins that we know about. Of course, some odd membership plugin that uses its own user login system might be incompatible with Watu.

= How to translate the plugin interface in my language or just change some of the texts =

You can use the standard WordPress way of translating plugins (via Poedit and .po / .mo files) or use plugin like Loco Translate.
If using Poedit, your file names should start with "watu-". For example: watu-de_DE.po / watu-de_DE.mo. They should be placed in wp-content/languages/plugins folder.

= Can I override the templates / views without modifying the plugin code? (For advanced users) =

Yes. You can create a folder called "watu" under your active WP theme folder. Then create a copy of the view file you want to modify, keep the original name, and place it in the "watu" folder there. (Do not create "views" folder). Then the copy of the template will be used instead of the original one.

= I'm getting "Error Occurred" message after submitting the quiz =
If you get "Error Occurred" when submitting a quiz, this is usually because there is too much data to be sent through Ajax. Watu normally uses Ajax to submit quizzes to make the user experience more pleasant. If your server cannot handle the data by Ajax for some reason (too much data, improper configuration, etc), you can switch off Ajax from Watu Settings page. Navigate near the bottom of the page and you will see heading "Ajax in quizzes". Select the problematic test(s) and save.

= How to create a "Retry Quiz" link or button? =

To let the user retry the quiz you simply need to take them back to the same page where the quiz is published (i.e. to refresh the page). So you can place a link or button in the "Final screen" of the quiz and that link or button will point to the quiz page itself.

= I added some third party JavaScript on the final screen but it does not work. What to do? =

If the script defines new objects it might not work in Ajax mode. Try to switch off Ajax for this quiz from Watu Settings page, then refresh the quiz page and submit again. This will usually solve the issue.

== Screenshots ==

1. List of your exams with shortcodes for embedding in posts or pages
2. The form for creating and editing an exam/test
3. You can add unlimited number of questions in each quiz or exam, and each question can be of single-answer, multiple-answer, or open-end type.
