Licenses of the maps:

!! IMPORTANT !!
The WordPress Plugin Review Team required us to provide opt-in feature to display attribution since it is part of [WordPress Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#10-plugins-may-not-embed-external-links-or-credits-on-the-public-site-without-explicitly-asking-the-user%e2%80%99s-permission). So you have to enable the checkbox "Display attribution (credit) in the map." at the WP OSM Plugin Shortcode generater or add the attribution manually to your map. Otherwise it may violate the map or data license, eg [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
