Lightbox for WordPress with social and viral features. Mobile friendly. Show photos, gallery, PDF, videos, WooCommerce images, inline content, Google Maps links.

== Description ==

Need a lightbox plugin to show various content on any device (from mobile to desktop)? ARI Fancy Lightbox is the right choice. 

It uses Fancybox popup to bring lightbox effect to WordPress sites. Use it to show images from native WordPress, NextGEN, FooGallery, Justified Image Grid and Jetpack galleries, photos, videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Vine, Metacafe services, PDF documents, Google Maps links, inline content, external pages into the lightbox.

It works with WordPress native and Jetpack (tiled, circle) galleries out of the box. Just install and activate the plugin and images from galleries will be opened into fancybox popup.

Easy to use, no need any additional modification of HTML code. Just select media items which want to display into the lightbox (for example YouTube or Vimeo videos) and the plugin attaches lightbox automatically to all appropriate links on your site.
