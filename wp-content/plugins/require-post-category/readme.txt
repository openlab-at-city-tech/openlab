= Translators =

* Spanish (es_ES) - [Andrew Kurtis - WebHostingHub](http://www.webhostinghub.com)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send the [PO and MO files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to [me](http://www.warpconduit.net/contact) so that I can bundle it into the plugin.
