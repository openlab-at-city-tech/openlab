- For Back-end: 12 CSS files merged & minified into 1 file.

- Bundled all JS files for improving load time, performance, and conflict by reducing the number of requests.
- For Front-end: 20 JS files merged & minified into 1 file.
- For Back-end: 22 JS files merged & minified into 1 file.

- In the admin, different CSS and js file has been separated. It has been loading based on the setting pages.

- We used lots of third-party JS Plugins. But right now we are using Elementor supported JS Plugins. Like:
1. Slick js
2. Magnific JS
3. Masonry
4. Date picker and so on.

- There was a Huge amount of unused CSS code. We have optimized all of them.

- There were like 200 lines of JS code that have been optimized. because:
- We can use HTML/CSS instead of JS like image-accordion etc
- Used cached js code(By function) instead of repeated code
- Some of the widgets like 'Timeline' widgets had heavy JS code. We make it totally lightweight. Such: Instead of raw scroll functionality, we have used Elementor waypoint function.

- We have removed vendor-prefixed extra code and again merged it into a CSS file.

- Fixed settings page bugs

- Improved settings design for a better look and best UI.

- Added version number for all of our enqueued CSS and js for default browser caching and it will improve overall site performance.
