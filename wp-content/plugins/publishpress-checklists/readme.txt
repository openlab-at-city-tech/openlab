Define checklist tasks to complete before publishing posts. Make sure your content meets your requirements.

== Description ==

[PublishPress Checklists](https://publishpress.com/checklists/) is the best plugin to make sure your content is ready to go live. Using PublishPress Checklists, you define tasks that must be completed before content is published.

Let's show you a few possible options for your posts:

* Ensure your posts have a minimum or maximum number of words.
* Require your posts have a featured image.
* Check for any broken links.
* Force authors to use a specific number of Tags or Categories.
* Require posts to be approved by a user in a specific role.
* Use OpenAI to scan your content and make sure it uses good grammar or the correct tone.

Next to every post and page, writers see a checklist box, showing the tasks they need to complete. Tasks can either be recommended or required. As authors complete each task, the red X automatically turns to a green checkmark.  

PublishPress Checklists integrates with [WooCommerce](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/woocommerce-product-tasks/), [Yoast SEO](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/yoast-seo-tasks/), [All in One SEO](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/all-in-one-seo-tasks/), [Rank Math SEO](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/rank-math-seo-tasks/),and [Advanced Custom Fields](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/advance-custom-fields-tasks/). You can set requirements based on those plugins.


PublishPress Checklists also [integrates with OpenAI](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/openai/). You can use OpenAI technology to scan your posts and check for the right tone, good spelling, or correct grammar.

## OpenAI Checklist Requirements

PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use prompts to analyze your content. If OpenAI decides that your content doesn't meet the requirements, it will show the task as incomplete.

You can create checklist requirements like these:</p>

* "Is the content clear and easy to read?"
* "Is this content tone professional?"
* "Does this article use correct grammar?"

OpenAI will scan your content and given a detailed verdict. This is an excellent way to catch errors and improve your content before publishing.

[Click here to see how to create OpenAI requirements](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/).

## You Can Create New Checklist Requirements

You can create new requirements for your checklists by clicking the “Add custom task” link. For example, you can require authors to get a green Yoast sign, or force them to run a spell-check before publishing.

[Click here to see how to create custom requirements](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/).

It is also possible to create more powerful requirements using a custom plugin. We have created a sample plugin to show how to do this. The sample plugin will automatically check that your site’s authors have included a specific word in their main content. If this new requirement is enabled, it will automatically search the text of your content to make sure it contains the word you choose.
