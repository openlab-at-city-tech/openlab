<strong>Over 12 MILLIONS DOWNLOADS and near PERFECT rating out of 200 REVIEWS</strong>. <br />
A powerful plugin, Order Posts and Post Types Objects using a Drag and Drop Sortable JavaScript capability. 

The order of posts can be customized directly on the default WordPress post type archive list page or through a dedicated Re-Order interface, which displays all available items. 
This feature allows you to easily reorder posts for any custom post types you've defined, including the default Posts. Managing post order has never been simpler.
  
= Usage =
This plugin was designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that anyone can easily use its sorting feature, regardless of their WordPress experience:

* Install the plugin via the "Install Plugins" interface or by uploading the post-types-order folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Activate the Post Types Order plugin.
* A new settings page will be added under Settings > Post Types Order. Visit this page and save the options for the first time.
* With the <strong>AutoSort</strong> option enabled, no code changes are needed, the plugin will automatically apply the customized post order.
* Use the Re-Order interface, available for every non-hierarchical custom post type, to change the post order as needed.
* For sorting posts via code, include 'orderby' => 'menu_order' within the custom query arguments. For more details, visit this guide [Sample Usage](http://www.nsp-code.com/sample-code-on-how-to-apply-the-sort-for-post-types-order-plugin/)

As you can see, reordering posts is as simple as dragging and dropping, with the changes instantly reflected on the front end. 

If the post order doesn’t update on your site, it could be due to one of two reasons: either there was a mistake during setup, or your theme/plugin is using a custom query that doesn't follow WordPress Codex standards. But don’t worry—we’re here to help! You can report the issue in the forum, where many users are happy to assist, or you can contact us directly.

If you encounter any problems with the plugin, feel free to reach out via the forum or contact us directly through our [support page](http://www.nsp-code.com), and we’ll take a look.

= Since I have no PHP knowledge at all, is this plugin for me? =

Absolutely! You don't need any PHP knowledge to use this plugin. 
Unlike many other plugins, you won't have to make any code changes for your custom post order to apply. There’s an option to automatically update WordPress queries so posts are displayed in your custom order. If you prefer to handle this manually, you can disable the **AutoSort** option.

= How to manually apply the sort in queries =

Simply include `'orderby' => 'menu_order'` in your custom query arguments.

= What types of posts/pages can I sort with this plugin? =

You can sort **all** post types you’ve defined in WordPress, as long as they are not hierarchical. This includes default post types like Posts, as well as custom types like Movies, Reviews, Data, etc.

= How does the post order apply in the admin interface? =

There’s an option to display the custom post order, as defined in the sort list, directly within the main admin post list interface.

= I have a feature request. Can it be implemented? =

All ideas are welcome! I add them to my list for future versions. However, this may take some time. If you're in a hurry, consider making a small donation, and I can prioritize the feature for you.

= Can I exclude certain queries from the custom sort when AutoSort is enabled? =

Yes, you can! To exclude certain queries, include the `ignore_custom_sort` argument in your custom query. An example is available at [Sample Usage](http://www.nsp-code.com/sample-code-on-how-to-apply-the-sort-for-post-types-order-plugin/)

= How can I force custom sorting for specific queries when AutoSort is enabled? =

You can use the `pto/posts_orderby` filter to force the sort. An example is provided at [Sample Usage](http://www.nsp-code.com/sample-code-on-how-to-apply-the-sort-for-post-types-order-plugin/)

= I need additional features like front-end sorting, shortcodes, filters, conditionals, advanced queries, or taxonomy/category sorting =

Consider upgrading to our advanced version of this plugin, which offers these features at a very reasonable price [Advanced Post Types Order](http://www.nsp-code.com/premium-plugins/wordpress-plugins/advanced-post-types-order/)
