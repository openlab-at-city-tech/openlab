== Description ==

<strong>Over 6.8 MILLIONS DOWNLOADS and near PERFECT rating out of 200 REVIEWS</strong>. <br />
A powerful plugin, Order Posts and Post Types Objects using a Drag and Drop Sortable JavaScript capability. 

The order can be customized within **default WordPress post type archive list page** or **a separate Re-Order interface** which displays all objects.
It allows reordering the posts for any custom post types you defined, including the default Posts.  Post Order has never been easier.

= Usage =
This plugin was developed considering everyone to be able to use the sorting feature, no matter the WordPress experience:

* Install the plugin through the Install Plugins interface or by uploading the `post-types-order` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the Post Order plugin.
* A new setting page will be created within Settings > Post Types Order, you should check with that, and make a first options save. 
* Using the <strong>AutoSort option as ON</strong> you don't need to worry about any code changes, the <strong>plugin will apply the customized post order</strong> on fly. 
* Use the Re-Order interface which appears to every custom post type (non-hierarchical) to change the post order to a new one.
* If prefer sort apply through the code, include 'orderby' =>'menu_order' within custom query arguments, more details at http://www.nsp-code.com/sample-code-on-how-to-apply-the-sort-for-post-types-order-plugin/

As you can see just a matter of drag and drop and post ordering will change on front side right away.

= Since I have no PHP knowledge at all, is this plugin for me? =

Absolutely, you can! 
Unlike many other plugins, you don't have to do any code changes to make your post order to apply, accordingly to custom-defined order. There is an option to auto-update the WordPress queries so the posts will be returned in customised order. This can be turned off (Autosort) to allow customized code usage.

= How to manually apply the sort on queries =

Include a 'orderby' => 'menu_order' property within your custom query arguments.

= What kind of posts/pages does this plugin allow me to sort? =

You can sort ALL post types that you have defined into your WordPress as long they are not <strong>hierarhically</strong> defined: Posts (default WordPress custom post type), Movies, Reviews, Data etc..

= Ok, i understand about the template post types order, how about the admin interface? =

There's an option you can trigger, to see the post types order as you defined in the sort list, right into the main admin post list interface.

= There is a feature that i want it implemented, can you do something about it? =

All ideas are welcome and i put them on my list to be implemented into the new versions. Anyway this may take time, but if you are in a rush, please consider a small donation and we can arrange something.

= Can i make certain queries to ignore the custom sort when Autosort is turned On? =

This can be done by including the ignore_custom_sort within custom query arguments. An example can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsp-code.com/advanced-post-types-order-api/sample-usage/">http://www.nsp-code.com/advanced-post-types-order-api/sample-usage/</a>

= How can i force the sort to apply for certain queries when AutoSort is turned On? =

A filter can be used to achieve that pto/posts_orderby. An example can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsp-code.com/ignore-sort-apply-for-certain-query-on-post-types-order/">http://www.nsp-code.com/ignore-sort-apply-for-certain-query-on-post-types-order/</a>

= I still need more features like front sorting interface, shortcodes, filters, conditionals, advanced queries, taxonomy/ category sorting etc =

Consider upgrading to our advanced version of this plugin at a very resonable price <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsp-code.com/premium-plugins/wordpress-plugins/advanced-post-types-order/">Advanced Post Types Order</a>
