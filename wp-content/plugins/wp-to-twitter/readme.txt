4. Adjust the WP to Twitter Options as you prefer them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are your Frequently Asked Questions? Why aren't they here? =

Right here: [WP to Twitter FAQ](http://www.joedolson.com/wp-to-twitter/support-2/). I don't maintain them here because I would prefer to only maintain one copy. This is better for everybody, since the responses are much more likely to be up to date!

= Twitter's Application creation process is very difficult. Why do I have to do this? =

WP to Twitter has always followed the principle that you are the owner of your own application. Many other applications require you to pass your data through a 3rd party that you authenticate to post to Twitter. Twitter has gradually made the process to create a new application more and more difficult. There is nothing I can do about that. 

= How can I help you make WP to Twitter a better plug-in? =

Writing and maintaining a plug-in is a lot of work. You can help me by providing detailed support requests (which saves me time), or by providing financial support, either via my [plug-in donations page](https://www.joedolson.com/donate/) or by [upgrading to WP Tweets Pro](http://www.wptweetspro.com/wp-tweets-pro). Believe me, your support really makes a difference!
