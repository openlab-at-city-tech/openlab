== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-to-twitter` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin using the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > XPoster
4. Adjust the XPoster Options as you prefer them. 
5. Create a Bluesky, Mastodon, or X application and configure your application with XPoster.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are you still calling things Tweets? =

As of version 5.0.0, I'm not. But if you see something still referencing a Tweet, let me know it! 

= Do I need to pay for an API plan at X.com? =

If you're publishing more than about 50 Tweets a day, you'll need to pay for a premium API plan. This is out of my control.

= X.com's Application creation process is very difficult. Why do I have to do this? =

XPoster has always followed the principle that you are the owner of your own application. Many other applications require you to pass your data through a 3rd party that you authenticate to post to Twitter. With the new API policies at X.com, this is a significant benefit to most users. X.com allows up to 1500 Tweets per month on their free API plan, which is practical for most independent sites.
