== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Simple Comment Editing is now Comment Edit Core? =
Yes.  We've renamed the plugin to make it easier to find and to more closely tie the plugin to the pro version.

= Why doesn't this plugin come with any styles? =
It's impossible to style an inline comment editor for every theme.  We've included basic HTML markup that is easily stylable to fit your theme.

With <a href="https://dlxplugins.com/plugins/comment-edit-pro/">Comment Edit Pro</a>, you can choose between three themes.

= Where are the options? =
No options :) - Just simple comment editing. If you prefer options, try out the paid add-on <a href="https://dlxplugins.com/plugins/comment-edit-pro/">Comment Edit Pro</a>.

= How do I customize this plugin? =
For advanced options, please see the <a href="https://sce.dlxplugins.com/">SCE Filter/Action reference</a> or get <a href="https://dlxplugins.com/plugins/comment-edit-pro/">Comment Edit Pro</a>.

= What browsers have you tested this with? =
Simple Comment Editing will work all the way back to IE10.
