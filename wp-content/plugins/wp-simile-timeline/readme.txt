Integrates the SIMILE Timeline into WordPress and provides an option interface for the various timeline settings.

== Description ==
This plugin integrates the [SIMILE Timeline](http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/ "SIMILE Timeline at SIMILE Labs") into WordPress and provides an option interface for the various timeline settings.
Developed by SIMILE Labs, the Timeline is a web widget for visualizing temporal data. 

Features:

*   Include individual categories to be displayed in the timeline
*	Build a lifestream timeline with RSS feeds from your WordPress link archive
*   Customize colors for timeline bands and categories
*   Supports multiple instances on different pages by using a template tag
*   Display individual icons or images with custom fields
*	Display image attachments from posts in the timeline
*	Comes with English, German, Italian and Spanish language files

Thanks to:

*	[SIMILE Project](http://simile.mit.edu) for providing the Timeline script API and releasing useful, semantic applications.
*	[John Lim of PHP Everywhere](http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/adodb_date_library) for creating the ADOdb Date Library, making date formatting with dates before 1970 a charm.
*	Gianni Diurno for the Italian translations.
*	[Marcis G.](http://pc.de) for the Belorussian translation

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the ZIP-archive
2. Delete or deactivate any previous versions of this plugin.
3. Copy or upload the folder `wp-simile-timeline` to the `/wp-content/plugins/`directory
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress plugins page
5. Include `<?php stl_simile_timeline(); ?>` or the shortcode `[similetimeline]` in your page or post
6. Specify the page ID of the page where you included the Timeline on the Options > SIMILE Timeline page
	This will output the necessary JavaScript and CSS in the HTML head
	(Set this value to 0 to include the Timeline script on all pages)
7. Enable categories on the Timeline options page

= Documentation =

To include the Timeline in a page or post, you can use a PHP template tag or WordPress shortcode:

*	`[similetimeline]`
*	`<?php stl_simile_timeline(); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= General problem solving =

*	If you encounter JavaScript alert dialogs/popups, the timeline has initialization or parsing problems. These error messages are triggered inside the SIMILE API and cannot be controlled by the plugin author.
	For support in this direction I recommend the [SIMILE Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/simile-widgets/) and the [SIMILE Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline).
*	Most basic problems have been discussed and mostly fixed in the [blog comments](http://www.freshlabs.de/journal/archives/2006/10/wordpress-plugin-simile-timeline/#comments).
*	[http://groups.google.com/group/wp-simile-timeline](http://groups.google.com/group/wp-simile-timeline) is the official discussion group of this plugin which replaces the blog comment support since 21-03-2009. 

= The timeline does not show up in my page or post =

*	Make sure you have the shortcode `[similetimeline]` included or `<?php stl_simile_timeline(); ?>` set up in your page or post.
*	Make sure the page-ID setting for the timeline is either 0 (zero) or an individual post ID. This option sets whether the neccessary JavaScript is loaded in the &#60;head&#62; section of your HTML. 
*	Try to clean your browser cache and then refresh the timeline page. Since the widget uses loads of JavaScript, changed settings often take a while until they replace the cached version.
*	Make sure that you have included the `wp_head()` function in your template header file. Otherwise the required JavaScript library by SIMILE will not be loaded.

= The timeline does not show any posts =

*	The content for the timeline is retrieved inside the XML file `/wp-content/plugins/wp-simile-timeline/data/timeline.xml.php`. Try to
call that file directly to see if posts show up there.
*	When the XML file shows posts and seems valid, try to clean your browser cache and refresh the timeline page.
*	Make sure you have checked at least one category to be timelined on the settings page and that there are public posts in that category.

= There are no titles showing in the timeline =

*	Please check if you have marked the checkbox *Show labels* for the desired band.
*	Try to clean your browser cache and then refresh the timeline page. Since the widget uses loads of JavaScript, changed settings often take a while until they replace the cached version.
