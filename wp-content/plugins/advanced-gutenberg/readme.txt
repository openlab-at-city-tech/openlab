== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the new buttons or new tools in PublishPress Blocks =

Yes, this is possible, from the Gutenberg profile management, select some blocks, then you can give the profile to a single user or a user role

Both are loaded from a separated stylesheet file and offer 2 ways to style your blocks. The Gutenberg default CSS class apply a CSS class on a single block then you can create your CSS on an external file.
