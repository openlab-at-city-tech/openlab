In different places: in Gutenberg itself by adding some options to existing blocks, by adding new blocks, as new menu named PublishPress Blocks

Yes, this is possible, from the Gutenberg profile management, select some blocks, then you can give the profile to a single user or a user role

Both are loaded from a separated stylesheet file and offer 2 ways to style your blocks. The Gutenberg default CSS class apply a CSS class on a single block then you can create your CSS on an external file.
