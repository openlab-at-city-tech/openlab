## CM Tooltip Glossary - The #1 WordPress Glossary Plugin 

The CM Glossary Tooltip is a robust WordPress plugin. It empowers you to **establish an extensive knowledgebase of terms and their definitions** on your website. 

Utilizing the Glossary plugin, you can easily establish an **extensive glossary featuring terms with corresponding definitions**. And we've been developing this since 2012!


### Glossary Terms Pages, Links and Glosary Index

This plugin operates by intelligently identifying glossary terms embedded within your posts or pages, incorporating links to a dedicated glossary page that offers detailed definitions for each term.

Furthermore, the plugin generates an adaptable glossary index, cataloging all the terms scattered across your website, and granting users convenient access to their respective definitions.

### Glossary Tooltips

This powerful tool also includes the tooltip plugin feature, allowing you to effortlessly **present dynamic a tooltip instantly emerges when users hover over the linked term**. 

This delivers a seamless and user-friendly method for users to swiftly access definitions.

== Code and Style Issues ==

The Glossary plugin creates tooltips with JavaScript. They are based on the article written by Michael Leigeber [here](http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create_lightweight_javascript_tooltip/) 
The Tooltip can be customized and styled through the tooltip.css and tooltip.js files.
The alphabetical index for the Glossary index is based on [jQuery ListNav Plugin](http://www.ihwy.com/labs/jquery-listnav-plugin.aspx)

== Installation ==

> [Detailed Free Version User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2162-cm-tooltip-cmtg-free-version-tutorial)

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Define your glossary terms under the glossary menu item in the administration interface.  The title of the page should be the term.  The body content should be the definition.
4. Creates a main Glossary page (example "Glossary") with no body content, if you so wish. If you do not create this page then your terms will still be highlighted, but without a central listing page of all your terms.
5. In the plugin's dashboard preferences, enter the main Glossary page's id (optional as above)
6. There are a handful of other optional preferences available in the dashboard.

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the Tooltip js and css to work properly.  If your theme does not support them you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).
