The Pro editions of the tooltip plugin for WordPress include even more powerful features, such as: audio and video tooltips, Wikipedia, Google Translate and Merriam-Webster integrations, terms with abbreviations and variations, multiple glossaries, several index templates and much more.

== Code and Style Issues ==

The Tooltip is created with JavaScript and is based on the article written by Michael Leigeber [here](http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create_lightweight_javascript_tooltip/) The Tooltip can be customized and styled through the tooltip.css and tooltip.js files.
The alphabetical index for the Glossary index is based on [jQuery ListNav Plugin](http://www.ihwy.com/labs/jquery-listnav-plugin.aspx)

> [Detailed Free Version User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2162-cm-tooltip-cmtg-free-version-tutorial)

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Define your glossary terms under the glossary menu item in the administration interface.  The title of the page should be the term.  The body content should be the definition.
4. Creates a main Glossary page (example "Glossary") with no body content, if you so wish. If you do not create this page then your terms will still be highlighted, but without a central listing page of all your terms.
5. In the plugin's dashboard preferences, enter the main Glossary page's id (optional as above)
6. There are a handful of other optional preferences available in the dashboard.

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the Tooltip js and css to work properly.  If your theme does not support them you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).
