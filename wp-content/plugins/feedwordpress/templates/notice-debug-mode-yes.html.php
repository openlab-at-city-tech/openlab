<div class="error">
<p><strong>FeedWordPress warning.</strong> Debugging mode is <strong>ON</strong>.
While it remains on, FeedWordPress displays many diagnostic error messages,
warnings, and notices that are ordinarily suppressed, and also turns off all
caching of feeds. Use with caution: this setting is absolutely inappropriate
for a production server.</p>
