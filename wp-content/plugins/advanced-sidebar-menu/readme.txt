== Description ==

<h3>Fully automatic sidebar menus.</h3>

Uses the parent/child relationship of your pages or categories to generate menus based on the current section of your site. Assign a page or category to a parent and Advanced Sidebar Menu will do the rest for you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The menu won't show up?

The menu in this plugin are smart enough to not show up on pages or categories where the only thing that would display is the title. While it may appear like the menu is broken, it is actually doing what it is intended to do.

The most common causes for this confusion come from one of these reasons:
1. The incorrect menu was selected. Categories have their own widget/block as pages have their own widget/block.
2. "Display the highest level parent page" or "Display the highest level parent category" is not checked.
3. The Pages menu is currently not being viewed on a page.
4. The Categories menu is not currently being view on a category.

= How do I change the styling of the current page? =

You may add CSS to your theme's style.css to change the way the menu looks.

For example the following CSS would:
1. Remove the dot to the left of the menu item.
2. Change the link color.
3. Add a background on hover.

<code>
.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current-menu-item a {
    color: black;
}
.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current-menu-item {
    list-style-type: none !important;
}
.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current-menu-item > a:hover {
	background: teal;
}
</code>

= How do you get the categories to display on single post pages? =

The Categories Menu widget/block contains a "Display categories on single posts" checkbox, which will display the category menus based on the categories the current post is assigned to.

= Does the menu change for each page you are on? =

Yes. Based on whatever page, post or category you are on, the menu will change automatically to display the current parents and children.
