== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Download Monitor" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I upload .xxx filetype using the uploader? =

Download Monitor uses the WordPress uploader for uploading files. By default these formats are supported:

* Images - .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
* Documents - .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx
* Music - .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav
* Video - .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2

To add more you can use a plugin, or filters. This post is a good resource for doing it with filters: [Change WordPress Upload Mime Types](http://www.paulund.co.uk/change-wordpress-upload-mime-types).

= Can I link to external downloads? =

Yes, you can use both local paths and external URLs.

= My Download links 404 =

Download links are powered by endpoints. If you find them 404'ing, go to Settings > Permalinks and save. This will flush the permalinks and allow our endpoints to be added.

= Download counts are not increasing when I download something =

Admin hits are not counted, log out and try!

More documentation can be found in our [Knowledge Base](https://www.download-monitor.com/kb/).
