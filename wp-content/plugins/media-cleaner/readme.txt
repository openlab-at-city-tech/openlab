Clean your WordPress! Eliminate unused and broken media files. For a faster, and better website.

== Description ==

Media Cleaner is a powerful plugin that helps you clean up your WordPress media library by deleting unused media entries and files, as well as fixing broken entries. With an internal trash feature, you can preview and confirm changes before permanently deleting anything. Plus, Media Cleaner uses smart analysis to ensure compatibility with specific plugins and themes. 

Use it alongside [Database Cleaner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/database-cleaner/) for the ultimate clean-up experience.

Media Cleaner is like a ninja assassin for your Media Library - it'll stealthily take out all the unnecessary media and broken entries that are cluttering up the place. Just make sure you have a **solid backup plan** in place before you let this bad boy loose. 

To learn more about compatibility, features, and the Pro version, check out the [tutorial](https://meowapps.com/media-cleaner/tutorial/) on the [official website](https://meowapps.com/media-cleaner/).

=== COMPATIBILITY ===

This plugin is compatible with all media types, including retina and WebP versions. It has been tested on a wide range of WordPress versions, including the latest version with Gutenberg, as well as on various themes with a large community of users. It also supports WooCommerce. For users with more complex plugins for handling website content, the Pro version may be necessary for optimal compatibility. We are constantly working to increase compatibility with other plugins.

* Live Site Scan: Analyzes the online version of your website, potentially improving accuracy in some cases.
* WP-CLI support: Allows you to run the plugin at a higher speed or automatically with direct server access (via SSH).
