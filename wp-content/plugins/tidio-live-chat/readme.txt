Our app merges live chat and chatbots in one tool to help you skyrocket your sales and level of customer service. Imagine that a potential client wants to leave you; the Tidio Chatbot can engage them 24/7 (you don’t even have to be online!), offering them help in case of an issue, or asking them for an email address for later contact. Your client is happy, and you have a new lead. Isn’t that excellent customer service?

= How does it work? =
Right after you install, open the “Tidio Chat” tab, and you’re ready to go! A chat widget will be visible on your website, so your visitors can contact you in real time. Once you access the Tidio dashboard, you can reply to any incoming chats, configure Chatbots, and manage other settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Tidio free? How much does it cost? =
Upon registering, a 7-day trial of an unlimited version of the app is assigned to your account. After the trial expires, you will be asked if you'd like to subscribe to a paid package (they start from $18 a month) or downgrade to the basic version. That way you are still able to use the chat for free, for an unlimited time :)

= Can I customise the chat widget? =
You can customise the chat widget by adjusting its colour, its position on your website (the bottom-right or bottom-left corner, or as a sidebar), all of the texts that appear in it, as well as some other options!

= Can my chat answer clients automatically? =
Yes, your chat can engage in simple conversations automatically; you can use the chatbots feature to create autoresponders and FAQ bots, and many others :)
