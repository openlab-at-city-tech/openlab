- The problem is in your WordPress theme. Use another theme, that does not interfere with post/pages images.
- You have other plugins that conflict with WP Lightbox 2. Disable your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict.
