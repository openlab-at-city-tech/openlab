The Gutenberg plugin provides editing, customization, and site building features to WordPress. This beta plugin allows you to test bleeding-edge features before they land in future WordPress releases.

== Description ==

“Gutenberg” is a codename for a whole new paradigm for creating with WordPress, that aims to revolutionize the entire publishing experience as much as Gutenberg did the printed word. The project is following a four-phase process that will touch major pieces of WordPress — Editing, Customization, Collaboration, and Multilingual. 

The block editor introduces a modular approach to all parts of your site: each piece of content in the editor, from a paragraph to an image gallery to a headline, is its own block. And just like physical blocks, WordPress blocks can be added, arranged, and rearranged, allowing WordPress users to create media-rich content in a visually intuitive way — and without work-arounds like shortcodes or custom HTML.

The block editor first became available in December 2018. We’re always hard at work refining the experience, creating more and better blocks, and laying the groundwork for the future phases of work. Each WordPress release comes ready to go with the stable features from multiple versions of the Gutenberg plugin, so you don’t need to use the plugin to benefit from the work being done here. However, if you’re more adventurous and tech-savvy, the Gutenberg plugin gives you the latest and greatest, so you can join us in testing bleeding-edge features, start playing with blocks, and maybe get inspired to build your own.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I send feedback or get help with a bug? =

We'd love to hear your bug reports, feature suggestions and any other feedback! Please head over to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues">the GitHub issues page</a> to search for existing issues or open a new one.
