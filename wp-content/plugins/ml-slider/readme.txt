Our simple and intuitive interface is perfect for individual users, developers and clients!

### Support for Every Type of Content Slider

MetaSlider provides unrestricted support for your image and photo slider, slide show, carousel, and gallery, including captions, links, title texts and alt text. With the [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) add-on you can also add video (YouTube/Vimeo), layer, html, product, and post feed content to a slider, slide show or carousel.

You can use any combination of MetaSlider Pro slide types for sliders, slideshows, and carousels. For example you can have a slider with an image slide, a post feed slide (that can contain multiple posts), and a video slide. To create this simply add slides as you normally would, selecting the relevant slide type each time.

The MetaSlider gallery currently supports image and photo content that can be added directly from your WordPress Media Library.

### Image Sliders

This may be the most basic slide type, but it still makes a great impression on any website! Present your beautiful images to a stunning slider, slide show, carousel, or gallery. Image slides are a basic slide type included in Meta Slider. An image slide will display an image with a caption. You can optionally link the slide to a URL of your choice.

Add images to your slide shows directly from your WordPress media manager, add the captions you want, set SEO fields and adjust the settings to display the slideshow just how you like it. Take it further with [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) and use the Theme Editor to change the look of the navigation, the arrows, and the captions.

### Photo Sliders

You can use responsive image slides and filmstrip navigation to create a simple but effective slideshow to show off your beautiful photographs and other images. Add a photo lightbox plugin with our [MetaSlider Lightbox add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider-lightbox/) to let people view the image as large as possible.

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can enhance your photo portfolio with Thumbnail and Filmstrip Navigation. Thumbnail and Filmstrip navigation for photos will both add a carousel row of thumbnails below your slider or slideshow. You can also customize the photo thumbnails to optimize the most engaging experience for your site visitors.

### Animated Layer Sliders

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can create animated Layer Slides for your slider, slideshow, or carousel. You can use the built in drag-and-drop editor to create CSS3 animated HTML Layer slides. MetaSlider Layer Slides are ideal for easily creating eye catching slider presentations and slideshows that use stunning effects with 50 animation options and a beautiful, easy to use interface. Layers can include text, html, images, photos, videos and even shortcodes! Layer Slide users also benefit from additional optimization and customization options, including using a video as the slide background and adjusting the padding and background color of each layer.

### Post Feed Sliders

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can create Post Feed slides to automatically show your latest content, blog posts, events or WooCommerce products in your slider, slide show, or carousel. MetaSlider Post Feed slides dynamically pull in slides based on your WordPress posts, using the featured image as the slide. They are also commonly known as “Content Sliders”, “Featured Sliders”, “Post Sliders” or “Dynamic Sliders”.

The post feed slide settings allow you to control which post types you want to display, the order to display them in and to restrict the posts to certain tags or categories. You can customise the caption template with a selection of template tags including {title}, {excerpt}, {author} and {date}. As with all our other slide types a Post Feed slide can appear in combination with any other slide type.

Post Feed slides can be used to show one post at a time but they work particularly well in carousel mode (as above) allowing you to show off a large number of your latest posts in a small amount of space.

### YouTube and Vimeo Video Sliders

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can easily include responsive high definition YouTube and Vimeo videos in your slider, slideshow, or carousel. A video slide will display a video in your slide show directly from Vimeo or YouTube. The video will automatically pause if the user skips to the next slide.

Simply add the URL of your video to a YouTube or Vimeo slide and MetaSlider will add it to your slider, slideshow, or carousel. Either create a slide show full of you favourite videos or mix it in between slides of other types to get just the result that you want.

If you select the FlexSlider option with video slides you can take advantage of MetaSliders play/pause functionality. This means that you can have your slideshow autoplay but will pause when you set a video to play and carry on once the video has finished. You could even have the slider or slide show autoplay to give you a smooth, completely automatic presentation!

### External and Local Video Sliders

External and Local Video Slides are included in [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/). With Local Video Slides you can build beautiful slideshows with videos in your WordPress media library. With External Video Slides you can created slideshows with videos hosted outside of your WordPress site.

Both External and Local Videos slides will display your MP4, WebM, and MOV videos with cover images, auto play, mute, lazy load, the ability to hide controls, and much more.

### External and Local Video Captions and Subtitles

It is possible to add video captions to both External Internal Video Slides created with [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/). This feature uses VTT files to add captions. There is a “CC” button in the toolbar that viewers can use to control the captions. 

### HTML Overlay Sliders

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can create completely customized HTML slides using the inline editor. We’ve even built-in over 50 awesome CSS3 transitions!

### External URL Sliders

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can create External URL Slides to load images for your slider, slideshow, or carousel directly from non-WordPress sources, for example CDN’s or image hosts.

### Sliders Make Any Site More Engaging

**Portfolio Sites**

Add some photos to your slider, slideshow, or carousel as layer slides, then add a layer covering the image set to a semi-transparent color to give a fantastic overlay. Then add some text that animates in to give some details about your company. Select the stretch option so that your slider, slideshow, or carousel fills the screen to really make an impact. Underneath that, add an image slide showing some of your latest work. Add our [MetaSlider Lightbox plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider-lightbox/) to let you zoom-in on the work. Or you could add a post slide in carousel mode, set to display a post type of your client with their logo as the featured image.

**Photography Gallery Sites**

You can use image slides and filmstrip navigation to create a simple but effective slider or slideshow to show off your beautiful photographs and other images. Plus, you can add a lightbox plugin with our MetaSlider Lightbox plugin to let people view the image as large as possible.

**Online Store**

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/), you can add a slider or slideshow with layer slides showing off your latest offers at the top, and then you can have a carousel post slide at the bottom displaying your product’s post type. Plus, MetaSlider works nicely with WooCommerce and allows you to use information such as the product price in the post slide template.

**News Site or Blog**

With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/), you can draw attention to your featured story, or you can use a Post Slide to display your latest posts with a slider, slideshow, or carousel.

You can use simple image slides to exhibit images relating to a featured story. You can combine that with a slider or slideshow that’s set to carousel mode and contains a post slide to display other stories. Then, you can use the Theme Editor to move and style the captions to fit your theme.

### Optimized for Speed

MetaSlider is fast. Only the minimum JavaScript/CSS is included on your page to power your slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery. We have optimized the Meta Slider plugin so that your images, photos, videos (YouTube and Vimeo), layers, html slides, products, and post feeds, load quickly without slowing down your website visitors’ experience.

### Unsplash Integration

MetaSlider is integrated with Unsplash to access free images and photos via Unsplash.com for your slider, slideshow, carousel, and gallery. Finding the right image or photo can be the hardest part of creating a compelling slider, slide show, carousel, or gallery, and MetaSlider makes this process easy for you by never leaving your WordPress plugin interface.

### Responsive and SEO-optimized

MetaSlider is a responsive, SEO-optimized WordPress plugin that lets you create a slider, slideshow, carousel, and gallery in seconds.

Your MetaSlider responsive slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery will adapt to the width of the device they’re being displayed on, including desktop, mobile or tablet. The content will be responsive regardless of the type of content you use: image, photo, video (YouTube and Vimeo), layer, product, and post feed slides.

The MetaSlider SEO tab lets you set image title and alt text for your slides. The title text should provide additional information about the slide, whereas the alt text should be used to describe the image itself. This data allows search engines to ‘read’ your slides and helps with search engine rankings!

### Powerful Editing Options

In addition to MetaSlider's simple drag-and-drop features, our slider, slide show, gallery, and carousel plugin for WordPress offers many powerful features. Whether you are someone running a site who wants to make a great first impression with beautiful photos or someone making websites for clients, MetaSlider enables you to create the perfect customized experience. These editing features support any content type, including image, photo, video (YouTube/Vimeo), layer, html, product, and post feed.

* **Full width slider and gallery support** MetaSlider will match your site design and is compatible with any WordPress theme that you choose to use.
* **Intelligent Image Cropping**: Unique Smart Crop functionality ensures your slides are perfectly resized. No fuss.
* **Smart Pad**: With cropping disabled, Smart Pad automatically adds padding to portrait images allowing you to mix portrait and landscape images and maintain a consistent slideshow height.
* **Drag-and-Drop editor**: Includes drag and drop slide reordering, intelligent image cropping, set image crop position.
* **Slider configuration**: Customize the transition effect, speed, timing, plus many more!
* **Live Theme Editor**: With [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) you can create unlimited themes and preview them on-the-fly.
* **Thumbnail Navigation (Pro)**: [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) adds in 2 new types of slider and slideshow navigation:
  * “Thumbnail” will output a static row of thumbnails below the slideshow. Compatible with Flex and Nivo Slider.
  * “Filmstrip” will output a carousel style row of thumbnails below the slideshow (with left and right navigation) – perfect if you have lots of slides! Compatible with Flex Slider.

### Flexible Workflow

MetaSlider is optimized for a fast and flexible workflow. You can preview your slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery directly from the editor in the MetaSlider dashboard. You can create the perfect design without switching back and forth between the dashboard and your page or post.

Adding a MetaSlider slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery is as easy as adding a shortcode to your WordPress page or post. The shortcode workflow creates maximum flexibility for embedding MetaSlider exactly where it will be most effective.

### Slider Themes

[MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) introduces the MetaSlider Theme Editor. MetaSlider Pro includes 11 free professional and responsive slide show themes for sliders, slideshows, and carousels. These themes enable you to effortlessly create beautiful and effective sliders, slideshows, and carousels designed by professionals.

The MetaSlider theme editor also allows you to create your own slider, slideshow, and carousel themes to use across your sites where you install MetaSlider. With these themes you can perfectly display any content, including image, photo, video (YouTube and Vimeo), layer, html, product, and post feed slides.

### Import and Export Your Sliders

With slider, slideshow, and carousel import and export you can move your perfectly designed sliders between your websites or your clients’ websites. Instead of recreating your settings on every website, export your slider, slideshow, or carousel with one click and import it to another WordPress suite just as easily with MetaSlider.

### Ready for the Gutenberg Block Editor

MetaSlider has been designed to also work seamlessly with the new Gutenberg WordPress Block Editor by using our Gutenberg block. We give you ultimate flexibility to embed MetaSlider into your WordPress website using a Gutenberg block, shortcode, or widget.

### Fully Localized with Translation Support

MetaSlider is compatible with some of the most popular WordPress translation plugins, including WPML, PolyLang & qTranslate. You can make sure that your slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery are fully localized for your audiences around the world. Localization supports any content you include in your slider, including image, photo, video (YouTube and Vimeo), layer, html, product, and post feed slides.

### Slider Lightbox Support

MetaSlider offers responsive image and photo lightbox support with the [MetaSlider Lightbox add-on](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/), allowing slides to be opened in a lightbox, using one of several supported lightbox plugins, including Easy FancyBox, Simple Lightbox, and FooBox Image Lightbox.

### Slider Plugin Integrations

MetaSlider is integrated with other popular WordPress plugins, including WooCommerce, the Events Calendar, and WPML. This enables you to seamlessly show the most engaging content to your audience in a slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery.

You can use the popular events management plugin “The Events Calendar” with MetaSlider’s new Post Feed Slides. MetaSlider detects if you have The Events Calendar plugin activated and offers you the ability to order by event date, so you can show off your upcoming events in a slider, slideshow, or carousel.

WooCommerce sliders are also easy with MetaSlider. You can show the products you choose in a stylish WooCommerce slideshow.

### Advanced Slider Developer Features

In addition to being the easiest to use WordPress slider, slideshow, carousel, and gallery plugin, MetaSlider also offers advanced developer features that make MetaSlider the most powerful plugin to create a slider, slideshow, carousel, and gallery:

### New Photo Gallery Experience

MetaSlider now features a new gallery experience that supports images and photos. With an easy drag-and-drop photo gallery builder, you can create a responsive and optimized photo gallery in seconds using the same WordPress Media Gallery images you are already using with MetaSlider sliders, slide shows, and carousels. You can use a simple shortcode (just like MetaSlider) to add the MetaSlider photo gallery to any page.

We are building the photo gallery following these principles:

* Fast - Using modern best practices, your responsive photo gallery will be faster than ever.
* SEO-focused - Search engines will love your photo gallery.
* Fully WCAG accessible - All users will be able to enjoy your responsive photo gallery.

You can create a photo gallery, and then add images to your gallery from the WordPress Media Library. Simply drag-and-drop images and photos into your gallery, easily reorder them, and add an image alt attribute to your images and photos to ensure that your gallery is SEO friendly. To make sure that your responsive photo gallery looks just right on your WordPress page or post, the MetaSlider gallery allows you to change the image and photo width, max width, min width, and spacing of your gallery.

The MetaSlider photo gallery also offers a distraction free fullscreen mode for gallery editing, and we will soon add to the photo gallery a dark mode and background color selection.

To add your responsive Meta Slider photo gallery to a page, simply click the “add to page” button in your gallery editor to generate a WordPress shortcode that you can drop onto any page or post.

The MetaSlider photo gallery is in development, and we would love to hear your feedback on the gallery and ideas for photo gallery features we should work on next.
