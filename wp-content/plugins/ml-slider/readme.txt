A video slide will display a video in your slide show directly from Vimeo or YouTube. The video will automatically pause if the user skips to the next slide.

Simply add the URL of your video to a [YouTube slide](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/youtube-slides/), [Vimeo slide](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/vimeo-slides/) or [TikTok slide](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/introduction-to-tiktok-slides/) and MetaSlider will add it to your slider, slideshow, or carousel. Either create a slide show full of you favorite videos or mix it in between slides of other types to get just the result that you want.

External and Local Video Slides are included in [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/). With Local Video Slides you can build beautiful slideshows with videos in your WordPress media library.

It is possible to add [video captions](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/video-captions-for-local-videos/) to both External and Internal Video slides created with [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/). This feature uses VTT files to add captions. There is a “CC” button in the toolbar that viewers can use to control the captions.

MetaSlider Post Feed slides dynamically pull in slides based on your WordPress posts, using the featured image as the slide. They are also commonly known as “Content Sliders”, “Featured Sliders”, “Post Sliders” or “Dynamic Sliders”.

The Post Feed slide settings allow you to control which post types you want to display, the order to display them in and to restrict the posts to certain tags or categories. You can customise the caption template with a selection of template tags including {title}, {excerpt}, {author} and {date}. As with all our other slide types a Post Feed slide can appear in combination with any other slide type.

### More Great MetaSlider Features

We have optimized the Free and Pro MetaSlider plugins so that your images, photos, videos (YouTube and Vimeo), layers, products, and post feeds, load quickly without slowing down your website visitors’ experience.

### Responsive and SEO-optimized

MetaSlider is a responsive, SEO-optimized WordPress plugin that lets you create a slider, slideshow, carousel, and gallery in seconds.

Your MetaSlider responsive slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery will adapt to the width of the device they’re being displayed on, including desktop, mobile or tablet.

The MetaSlider SEO tab lets you set image title and alt text for your slides. The title text should provide additional information about the slide, whereas the alt text should be used to describe the image itself. This data allows search engines to ‘read’ your slides and helps with search engine rankings!

With these themes you can perfectly display any content, including image, photo, video (YouTube and Vimeo), layer, product, and post feed slides.

### Import and Export Your Sliders

With [the MetaSlider import and export feature](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/export-and-import-slideshows/) you can move your perfectly designed sliders between your websites or your clients’ websites. Instead of recreating your settings on every website, export your slider, slideshow, or carousel with one click and import it to another WordPress suite just as easily with MetaSlider.

### Ready for the Gutenberg Block Editor

MetaSlider has been designed to work seamlessly with the new Gutenberg WordPress Block Editor by using our Gutenberg block. We give you ultimate flexibility to embed MetaSlider into your WordPress website using a Gutenberg block, shortcode, or widget.

### Fully Localized with Translation Support

MetaSlider is compatible with some of the most popular WordPress translation plugins, including WPML, PolyLang & qTranslate. You can make sure that your slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery are fully localized for your audiences around the world. MetaSlider localization supports any content you include in your slider.

### Slider Lightbox Support

MetaSlider offers responsive image and photo lightbox support with the [MetaSlider Lightbox add-on](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/), allowing slides to be opened in a lightbox, using one of several supported lightbox plugins, including Easy FancyBox, Simple Lightbox, and FooBox Image Lightbox.

### Slider Plugin Integrations

MetaSlider Pro is integrated with other popular WordPress plugins, including [WooCommerce](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/metaslider-and-woocommerce/), [The Events Calendar](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/metaslider-and-the-events-calendar/), [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/advanced-custom-fields-metaslider/), and [WPML](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/wpml). This enables you to seamlessly show the most engaging content to your audience in a slider, slideshow, carousel, or gallery.

You can use the popular events management plugin “The Events Calendar” with MetaSlider’s new Post Feed Slides. MetaSlider detects if you have The Events Calendar plugin activated and offers you the ability to order by event date, so you can show off your upcoming events in a slider, slideshow, or carousel.

WooCommerce sliders are also easy with MetaSlider. You can show the products you choose in a stylish WooCommerce slideshow.

### Carousel Sliders

In addition to creating traditional sliders and slideshows, you can use MetaSlider to build carousels that allow you to show multiple images at any one time. [MetaSlider carousels](https://www.metaslider.com/docs/carousel-slideshow/) are compatible with all slide types in Free and Pro, including image, photo, video (YouTube, Vimeo, and local), layer, WooCommerce product, and Post Feed slides. They’re ideal for showing a list of your latest posts or to use as a “Featured Product” slider for your homepage.

### Support for Every Type of Content Slider

MetaSlider provides unrestricted support for your image and photo slider, slide show, carousel, and gallery, including captions, links, title texts and alt text. With the [MetaSlider Pro](https://www.metaslider.com/upgrade/) add-on you can also add video (YouTube/Vimeo), layer, product, and post feed content to a slider, slide show or carousel.

You can use any combination of MetaSlider Pro slide types for sliders, slideshows, and carousels. For example you can have a slider with an image slide, a post feed slide (that can contain multiple posts), and a video slide. To create this simply add slides as you normally would, selecting the relevant slide type each time.

### New Photo Gallery Experience

MetaSlider now features a new gallery experience that supports images and photos. With an easy drag-and-drop photo gallery builder, you can create a responsive and optimized photo gallery in seconds using the same WordPress Media Gallery images you are already using with MetaSlider sliders, slide shows, and carousels. You can use a simple shortcode (just like MetaSlider) to add the MetaSlider photo gallery to any page.

We are building the photo gallery following these principles:

* Fast - Using modern best practices, your responsive photo gallery will be faster than ever.
* SEO-focused - Search engines will love your photo gallery.
* Fully WCAG accessible - All users will be able to enjoy your responsive photo gallery.

You can create a photo gallery, and then add images to your gallery from the WordPress Media Library. Simply drag-and-drop images and photos into your gallery, easily reorder them, and add an image alt attribute to your images and photos to ensure that your gallery is SEO friendly. To make sure that your responsive photo gallery looks just right on your WordPress page or post, the MetaSlider gallery allows you to change the image and photo width, max width, min width, and spacing of your gallery.

The MetaSlider photo gallery also offers a distraction free fullscreen mode for gallery editing, and we will soon add to the photo gallery a dark mode and background color selection.

To add your responsive Meta Slider photo gallery to a page, simply click the “add to page” button in your gallery editor to generate a WordPress shortcode that you can drop onto any page or post.

The MetaSlider photo gallery is in development, and we would love to hear your feedback on the gallery and ideas for photo gallery features we should work on next.
