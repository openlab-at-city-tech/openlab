== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

Feel free to contact me at electronice_delphi@yahoo.com

= I have no PHP knowledge at all, i will still be able to use this plugin? =

Yes, this is the right tool for you. The plugin come with a unique feature to update the queries on the fly and return the terms in the required ored without changing any line of code. Or as alternative you can do that manually.

= What taxonomies will allow me to sort? =

You can sort ALL taxonomies, including the default Categories.

= Is there any way i can get my admin interface to use the custom terms order? =

Absolutelly, the plugin can do that. In fact you can configure so only the admin will update and the front side template will display the terms as before.

= There is a feature that i want it implemented, can you do something about it? =

All ideas are welcome and i put them on my list to be implemented into the new versions. Anyway this may take time, but if you are in a rush, please consider a small donation and we can arrange something.
