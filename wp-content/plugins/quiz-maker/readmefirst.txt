*For MacBook Users
As you already know, you need the zip file of the plugin to upload. But as for MacBook, the downloaded file is extracted originally.
To compress a file on your Mac, control-click it or tap it with two fingers. Then, select Compress from the shortcut menu. You will now be able to upload this zip file to your website.

*There may be a conflict with the upload_max_file_size value while uploading the plugin. The zip file is big and the limit for it may be small.
If you are experiencing this case, please get in touch with your Hosting Provider and ask them to expand the values or do it on your own via the cPanel.
upload_max_filesize 64
max_execution_time 600
max_input_time 600

*In case you make a purchase for the the Mega bundle, you need to unzip the downloaded zip file and find 3 different zip files inside it.
Then install them separately (one by one).
