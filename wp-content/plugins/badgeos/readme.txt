BadgeOS turns your site into an achievement and badging system. Easily create badges and set up the steps and achievements users complete to earn them.

== Description ==

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement, badging and engagement management system. Your users complete steps, demonstrate skills and knowledge, and earn digital badges/points/ranks. Easily define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Create badges and set up the achievements/points/ranks to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and shareable via BadgeOS Social Share add-on

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many point types can be created? =

Unlimited point types can be created

= How many rank types can be created? =

Unlimited rank types can be created

= What is the default rank? =

Default rank is the one with the "0" priority. It will automatically be rewarded to all the users. If you don't want to create a default rank then set its priority more than "0" like 1,2 etc.

= What is the difference between rank and achievement? =

An achievement can be earned multiple times but the rank will only be earned once. Achievement is like a step while rank is like a level.

= Any ideas for making badge images? =

Yes! After installing BadgeOS, enable Credly Integration in the BadgeOS menu. That will seamlessly integrate the Credly "[Badge Builder](https://credly.com/badge-builder-home "Credly tool for designing badge images")" into your WordPress site so you can design your own professional-looking badge images.  (First get a [free account](https://credly.com/#!/create-account "Create a free Credly account") at Credly.com if you do not have one.)

= Can you help us design custom badge images? =

Yes, our designers are available to create custom badges that represent your brand, the kind of achievements you recognize, and the audience you are reaching.  From a single badge to a complete constellation, our team of professional badge designers get to know your needs through a tested Badge Design Process which consistently produces successful and delightful results.

See examples and learn more at: [http://badgeos.org/services/badge-design/](http://badgeos.org/services/badge-design/ "Badge Design")

= Do you offer services to help us design, build or customize our BadgeOS site? =

Yes, we do. We especially enjoy working on innovative projects with forward-thinking teams extending achievement recognition into new environments and surfacing achievement in new ways. See [examples](http://badgeos.org/about/sample-sites/ "Sample pojects") and learn more at: [http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/](http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/ "BadgeOS Customization").

= Where should I report issues or bugs? =

The ideal place for bug and issue reporting is on the [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") site for the BadgeOS project.

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.) Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
