BadgeOS turns your site into an achievement and badging system. Easily create badges and set up the steps and achievements users complete to earn them.

== Description ==

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; allows you to gamify your WordPress site by rewarding users with digital badges, points and ranks for interacting with the website.

You can easily create unlimited achievements and ranks using different actions as triggers. You can also award different point types to your users based on the tasks they complete.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many point types can be created? =

Unlimited point types can be created

= How many rank types can be created? =

Unlimited rank types can be created

= What is the default rank? =

Default rank is the one with the "0" priority. It will automatically be rewarded to all the users. If you don't want to create a default rank then set its priority more than "0" like 1,2 etc.

= What is the difference between rank and achievement? =

An achievement can be earned multiple times but the rank will only be earned once. Achievement is like a step while rank is like a level.

= Any ideas for making badge images? =

Yes! After installing BadgeOS, enable Credly Integration in the BadgeOS menu. That will seamlessly integrate the Credly "[Badge Builder](https://credly.com/badge-builder-home "Credly tool for designing badge images")" into your WordPress site so you can design your own professional-looking badge images.  (First get a [free account](https://credly.com/#!/create-account "Create a free Credly account") at Credly.com if you do not have one.)

= Can you help us design custom badge images? =

Yes, our designers are available to create custom badges that represent your brand, the kind of achievements you recognize, and the audience you are reaching.  From a single badge to a complete constellation, our team of professional badge designers get to know your needs through a tested Badge Design Process which consistently produces successful and delightful results.

= Where should I report issues or bugs? =

The ideal place for bug and issue reporting is on the [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") site for the BadgeOS project.

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.)
