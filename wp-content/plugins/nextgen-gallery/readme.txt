== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Why are my photo galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site? =

This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: <a href="https://www.imagely.com/docs/galleries-opening-lightbox/" target="_blank">Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?</a>.
