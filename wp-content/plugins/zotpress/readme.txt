Zotpress displays your Zotero citations on WordPress.

== Description ==

[Zotpress](http://katieseaborn.com/plugins/ "Zotpress for WordPress") brings publication broadcasting and scholarly blogging to WordPress through [Zotero](http://zotero.org/ "Zotero"), a free, cross-platform reference manager.

= Features =
* Displays your personal and group Zotero items through in-text citations, bibliographies, and searchable libraries
* Supports thumbnail images through WordPress's Media Library and Open Library
* Supports selective CSS styling via IDs and classes
* Provides a range of additional features, such as allowing visitors to download citations
* And more!

Compatible with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and IE9. Made with jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery doTimeout, Live Query, OAuth, and [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/ "Open Library").

Special thanks to Joe Alberts for substantial contributions to the code, comprehensive testing, and design ideation. Thanks also to contributors Christopher Cheung, Jason S., Chris Wentzloff, Karljürgen Feuerherm (@feuerherm), Mark Dingemanse (@codeispoetry), Jörg Mechnich (jmechnich@github), Tomas Risberg, and @ericcorbett2 for their code contributions, testing, and guidance. Finally, my sincere gratitude goes out to all who have donated in support of this plugin.

Please note that this plugin is on semi-hiatus, with updates expected about 1-3 times a year.

= Requirements =
jQuery included in your theme (Zotpress will do this for you if it isn't already included), and an HTTP request method supported by WordPress enabled on your server: cURL, fopen with Streams (PHP 5), or fsockopen. In your server config file, X-Frame-Options should be set to SAMEORIGIN. Optional: OAuth enabled on your server.

== Installation ==

1. Install from the `Plugins` page in your WordPress admin panel. Or, download and extract the zip, then manually upload the folder `zotpress` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the `Zotpress` page through the admin menu.
1. Add the Zotero API information for each Zotero account you'd like to use.
1. Use the Zotpress Shortcode option in the Gutenberg editor to serach for items and build a shortcode. Or, look up the keys of items, collections, and tags on the `Browse` page. Or, use the Zotpress Reference Meta Box to generate shortcodes.
1. Place the shortcodes in your blog post or page, or enable the Zotpress sidebar widget. Below are a few examples to get you started. Look at the `Help` page for more examples and the full details about all use options and shortcodes.

= Shortcode =
You can display your Zotero citations in a number of ways. To display a list of five citations from the collection with the key "ZKDTKM3X", use this shortcode:

> [zotpress collection="ZKDTKM3X" limit="5"]

You can also use in-text citations as follows:

> [zotpressInText item="{U9Z5JTKC,36-45}"]

> [zotpressInTextBib]

The first shortcode will display an in-text citation for an item with the key "U9Z5JTKC", which will look something like this: (Seaborn, 2011, p. 36). The [zotpressInTextBib] will auto-generate a bibliography for all [zotpressInText] shortcodes on the post/page.

Check out the "Help" page on your installation of Zotpress for more information and a full listing of parameters for all shortcodes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The F.A.Q. can be found on the "Help" page of every Zotpress installation. If you have a question that isn't answered there, feel free to post a message in the [forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/zotpress "Zotpress forums on Wordpress.com").

== Screenshots ==

1. Display items from individual or group Zotero libraries on your WordPress website. Special characters are supported.
2. Search for items and generate shortcodes for bibliographies and in-text citations using the "Zotpress Reference" meta box on edit screens.
3. Find the shortcode builder in the Gutenberg toolbar. Search for items and create bibliographies and in-text citations.
4. Give your citation an image using WordPress's Media Library or Open Library.
5. Share your library through your website. Allow visitors to browse by collection or tag.
6. Allow visitors to search your library by item metadata or tag, or both.

* Meta box fixed in IE and Safari.
* Styles fixed in IE and Safari.

= 3.0.1 =

* Sidebar widget fixed.
* Styles in IE refined.
* Conditional OAuth messages implemented.

= 3.0 =

* New "Zotpress Reference" widget, meant to speed up the process of adding shortcodes to your posts and pages by allowing you to selectively search for ids directly on the add and edit pages.
* OAuth is now supported, which means that you don't have to go out of your way to generate the required private key for your Zotero account anymore (unless your server doesn't support OAuth, of course).
* I've changed the way Zotpress's admin splash page loads. Before, the page would hang until finished loading the latest citations from Zotero. This is a friendlier way of letting you know what Zotpress is up to.
* Manual re-caching and clear cache options added, for those who desire to refresh the cache at their leisure.
* Citations that have URLs will now have their URLs automatically hyperlinked.
* More IDs and classes added for greater CSS styling possibilities.
* Improved handling of multiple Zotpress shortcode calls on a single page.
* Code reduced and refined plugin-wide, which should equal an overall performance improvement.
* "Order" parameter no longer available, at least for now; see http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api
* "Forcing cURL" option abandoned. If your server supports it, cURL will be used; otherwise, Zotpress will resort to file_get_contents().

= 2.6.1 =

* Can now give group accounts a public key.
* Downloads can now be accessed by anyone (assuming you've enabled downloading).

= 2.6 =

* Important: Reduced multiple instantiations of JavaScript.
* Download option added to Widget.
* Proper download links for PDFs implemented.

= 2.5.2 =

* Fixed image display for author/year citations.

= 2.5.1 =

* Fixed single citation display bug.

= 2.5 =

* Re-wrote display code.
* Tidied up JavaScript.
* Fixed update table code.

= 2.4 =

* Can now display by year.
* New option to display download links, should they be available.

= 2.3 =

* Fixed Group "invalid key" error.

= 2.2 =

* Fixed CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION error.

= 2.1 =

* Now cURL-friendly again.

= 2.0 =

* Zotpress completely restructured.
* Most requests now made through PHP. Shortcode requests made through PHP/jQuery combo for user-friendliness on the front-end.
* Cross-user caching implemented. Updates request data every 10 minutes and only if request made.
* Increased security now that private keys are no longer exposed through JavaScript.
* Can now filter by Tag in admin.

= 1.6 =

* Critical request method issue fixed.

= 1.5 =

* Groups citation style issue fixed.

= 1.4 =

* Caching enabled, which should speed things up a bit.

= 1.3 =

* Added cURL, which is (maybe?) quicker, (definitely?) safer, and (more likely to be?) supported. Requests default to cURL first now.

= 1.2 =

* Optimized JavaScript functions. Fixed some grammatical errors on the Help page. More selective loading of JavaScript. And most importantly ... added a Zotpress widget option. This also means you can have more than one Zotpress call on a single page.

= 1.1 =

* Fixed up the readme.txt. Added a friendly redirect for new users. Made IE8-compliant. Moved some JS calls to footer. Now selectively loads some JS. Made tags and collections into lists for easier formatting.

= 1.0 =

* Zotpress makes its debut.
