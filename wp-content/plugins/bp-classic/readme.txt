BP Classic, a BuddyPress (12.0.0 & up) backwards compatibility add-on

== Description ==

The BP Classic add-on is being developed and maintained by the official BuddyPress development team.

It was first built to provide backwards compatibility to configs where third party BuddyPress plugin(s) or theme(s) - not ready yet for the BP Rewrites API (introduced in BuddyPress 12.0.0) - are activated.

BP Classic also includes features and templates that are fully deprecated in BuddyPress 12.0.0. Here are the ones you will now find back only once you activated the BP Classic add-on:

- The BP Legacy widgets (these were migrated as Blocks in BuddyPress 9.0.0).
- The BP Default theme.
- The BP Legacy navigation globals (`buddypress()->bp_nav` & `buddypress()->bp_options_nav`).

**NB**: although the BP Classic add-on only runs when the BuddyPress version is 12.0.0 or up, you can choose to anticipate the BuddyPress 12.0.0 upgrade by activating the add-on. In this case the add-on is in "sleep mode" and will wake up as soon as BuddyPress has been upgraded to 12.0.0.
