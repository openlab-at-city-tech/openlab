Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. It ships with an integrated demo.

== Description ==
Redux was built by developers for developers. We save you months if not years in your development time. Everything we do is to help innovation in the industry.

<h4>‚ô•Ô∏è What the Plugin does?</h4>
Redux is a simple, genuinely extensible, and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API; Redux supports many field types, custom error handling, custom fields & validation types, and import/export functionality.

But what does Redux actually DO? We don't believe that theme and plugin developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a project. Redux simplifies the development cycle by providing a streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an options panel limited only by their imagination in a fraction of the time it would take to build from the ground up!

<li>Field validation and sanitization</li>
<li>Field and section disabling</li>
