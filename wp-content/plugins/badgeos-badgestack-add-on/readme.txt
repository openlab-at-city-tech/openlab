This add-on to BadgeOS automatically creates achievement types, pages and sample content to jumpstart your own badging system.

== Description ==

The BadgeStack add-on to [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS") automatically sets up achievement types and pages for Levels, Quests, Quest Badges and Community Badges and installs sample content for each.

BadgeStack requires that you first install and activate the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS") plugin.

[BadgeOS](http://www.badgeos.org "BadgeOS") turns your WordPress site into an achievement and badging system.

The BadgeStack add-on to BadgeOS automatically creates all the achievement types and pages needed to quickly set up your very own badging system. Levels, Quest Badges, Quests and Community Badges are all ready upon activating the plugin, as are pages with shortcodes for each achievement type. BadgeStack also includes a set of sample achievements and badges. A great way to bring some instant organization to your site and to get started with badging. This add-on is made possible in part due to the generous support of HASTAC, through the DML Badging Competition.

Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for recognizing and displaying lifelong achievement.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

= Can you help us design custom badge images? =

From a single badge to a complete constellation, our team of professional badge designers get to know your needs through a tested Badge Design Process which consistently produces successful and delightful results.

= Do you offer services to help us design, build or customize our BadgeOS site? =

Yes, we do. We especially enjoy working on innovative projects with forward-thinking teams extending achievement recognition into new environments and surfacing achievement in new ways. See [examples](http://badgeos.org/about/sample-sites/ "Sample pojects") and learn more at: [http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/](http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/ "BadgeOS Customization").

= Where should I report issues or bugs? =

The ideal place for bug and issue reporting is on the [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") site for the BadgeOS project.

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.) Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
