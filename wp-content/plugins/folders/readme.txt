= How Folders Plugin Can Help You =

There are several ways professionals are using the Folders file manager plugin to organize their WordPress content:

* Keep all of your media files organized in folders and subfolders, including photos, videos, music, main website pages and blog posts. You can also place media in multiple subfolders, such as images used on different pages. 
* Web developers: keep your clients’ website pages in proper order during and after development. You can also mark a folder with a star or give it a unique name for clients to understand what is important and what they should (or shouldn't) touch. 
* Bloggers: manage your own content with ease with this file manager plugin. Never get confused again – organize photos and content by topics, categories, and/or dates. 
* Quickly upload pages, media, and content to your WordPress and easily organize them into directories so they’re never lost. It’s content creation and organization at its finest!
* Mark certain folders as important to quickly find the content you need for your WordPress projects and tasks. No worries of your content getting lost in a sea of directories!

<strong>Note:</strong> adding a page/post/image into a folder will not change its URL.
