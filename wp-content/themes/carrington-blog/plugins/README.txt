## plugins/

Carrington supports plugins in the same conceptual manner as WordPress. Carrington includes several hooks and filters so you can customize/override Carrington's default behavior.

Any .php files placed in this directory will be auto-loaded and processed by Carrington.

This is the recommended way to interact with the hooks and filters provided by Carrington so that they can be easily distributed with the theme.

This directory is not used by the Carrington engine (template naming conventions are not supported), it is provided solely for convenience and for better organization of these files.
