# Koji

Koji is a clean and lightweight theme for bloggers. It features a masonry grid on the archive pages, a beautiful and minimal design, Block Editor/Gutenberg support, widget areas in the sidebar and the footer, infinite scroll loading that can be set to load more posts on button click or when the visitor reaches the bottom of the page, settings for what post meta to display on archive pages and on single posts, icon links to social media pages, custom logo support, a search overlay that can be accessed from any page, and much more.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
