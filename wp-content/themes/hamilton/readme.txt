== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme
2. Activate the theme

All theme specific options are handled through the WordPress Customizer.


== Resume Page Template ==

1. Create a new page, or edit an existing one
2. Click the dropdown beneath "Template" in "Page Attributes", and select Resum.

In the resume page template, all titles span the entire width of the content, whereas all other elements are aligned to the right. This enables you to create sections in the resume content by simple adding another title. For instance, adding a title called "Education" and adding a paragraph of text beneath it will automatically create a section with the "Education" title to the left and the paragraph of text to the right.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I activate infinite scroll? =
Hamilton uses the Jetpack module for infinite scroll. To activate it, install the Jetpack plugin and activate the infinite scroll module in the Jetpack settings. The theme will take care of the rest.

= What do the Hamilton theme options in the WordPress customizer do? =
Show Primary Menu in the Header — Replaces the navigation toggle in the header with the Primary Menu on desktop.
Three Columns — Displays the post grid with up to three columns on desktop. The grid will still be displayed with two columns on tablets and mobile screen sizes.
Show Preview Titles — Always display the post titles on top of the images in post previews, rather than on hover which is the default behaviour.
Front Page Title – The title you want shown on the front page when the "Front page displays" setting is set to "Your latest posts" in Settings > Reading.
Dark Mode (displayed in the Colors tab) — Displays the site with white text and black background. If Background Color is set, only the text color will change. You can combine the background color with the dark mode to, for instance, display the site with a dark purple background color and white text color.
