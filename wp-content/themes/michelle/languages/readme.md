# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.


## Translating the theme

If you have obtained the theme from **[WordPress.org themes repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/webmandesign/)**, please translate the theme by clicking the [Translate Michelle](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/michelle) link in [theme page](https://wordpress.org/themes/michelle/) sidebar.

Otherwise follow these instructions:

1. Make a copy of the original `michelle.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the copied file now: add hyphen followed with [your language code locale](https://translate.wordpress.org/), and change file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named `michelle-en_GB.po`, for example.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation in `mo` file format.
4. Upload translated `michelle-en_GB.mo` file into your WordPress languages directory, into `themes` folder (such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/michelle-en_GB.mo` - if the `themes` folder does not exist in your WordPress languages directory, create it).


## Contributing your translations back to the theme

Otherwise, if you would like to help out translating the theme, please contribute on our [Support Center](https://www.webmandesign.eu/reference/#links-support).
