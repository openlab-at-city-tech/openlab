DESCRIPTION
**************************************************

I found an effect I really liked at phatfusion.com and aaronbirchphotography, which is called image menu. I created a wordpress theme round it called sliding doors.


**************************************************
HOW TO SET UP THE SLIDING MENUS
**************************************************

1. Go into Appearance - Menus 
2. Create a New menu and add 7 Pages or categories to it.
3. A new dropdown will appear on the left called 'Sliding Navigation' Select your new menu here.

**************************************************
HOW TO CHANGE THE IMAGES
**************************************************

1. Make the images using photoshop
You can download the original photo shop file from the theme homepage. 
The titles of the images are changed by editing the image in photoshop. 
Get any picture, crop it to 320 x 200, then write the text on it, and save it as a jpg.
Try to make the filesize small - in photoshop you do this by 'save for web' and choose medium or low quality - not high.

2. Go to a post and select 'upload image'
3. Select 'use as featured image'. This will set that image to the sliding door for that page.
